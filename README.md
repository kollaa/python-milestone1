# python-milestone1

In this we use the python flask-restufl to use crud operations

they are mainly fours tasks to do we should read the data from the csv and store that data in the database and that is called retriving

the next one is a spliting we should get the data from the database and store that data in xlsx or pdf 

and the next one is a converting we converting the two things docx to pdf and xlsx to pdf 

and the next one is a merging the multiple pdf's to a single pdf 

and we have achived through using microservices in a python by creating four different files and giving four different ports to work at a time
